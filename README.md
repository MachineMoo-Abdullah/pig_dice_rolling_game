# pig_dice_rolling_game
In this dice game, 2 to 4 players roll a dice to score points. Rolling a 1 loses all points for that turn, while rolling 2-6 adds to the turnâ€™s score. Players take turns until someone reaches 50 points. The player with the highest score wins. This game helps practice basic programming concepts like loops and random number generation.
